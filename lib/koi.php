/**
 * Koi is a very lightweight framework inspired by both Innate and Sinatra (Ruby frameworks).
 * It has no MVC, no models or authentication libraries. However, what it does offer is a rock solid
 * system for creating your own framework whether it's MVC or not.
 *
 * Out of the box Koi enables you to do the following:
 *
 * * Work with a very easy to use framework ;)
 * * Easily build your own framework (MVC or not)
 * * Render a view using HAML, HTML, Smarty, etc
 * * Easily work with cookies, sessions, log files, etc
