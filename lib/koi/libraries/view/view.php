<?php

namespace Koi\View;

/**
 * The View class is the only class that's related to the MVC pattern and is used to
 * render HTML, Smarty templates and so on. The basic use involves creating
 * a new instance of the View class and calling the render() method.
 *
 * bc. $v = new Koi\View\View("Koi rocks!");
 * $v->render();
 *
 * It's also possible to load a view by path, simply set the second argument
 * to a valid file path and the view system will copy the contents of this file into
 * the driver.
 *
 * bc. $v = new Koi\View\View('/path/to/view/file.php');
 * $v->render();
 *
 * Please note that the View class itself will not actually render the view file.
 * Instead it will load the driver based on the specified engine and use that to
 * render the view.
 *
 * h2. Creating Drivers

 * When creating a driver your class should implement the View interface to ensure all the
 * required method are available.
 *
 * For more information see Koi\View\ViewInterface in lib/koi/libraries/view/interface.php.
 *
 * h2. Adding a Driver
 *
 * Adding a new driver can de done by updating the $drivers array (a static array). The key
 * of each item is the name of the driver (lowercase) and the value a string that contains
 * the full namespace and class name for the driver. Example:
 *
 * @Koi\View\View::$drivers['cheese'] = 'Koi\View\Cheese';@
 *
 * Note that while it's not required it is recommended to put the view drivers under the same
 * namespace as all default drivers (Koi\View\CLASSNAME).
 *
 * h2. Available Drivers
 *
 * By default Koi ships with the following drivers:
 *
 * * Mustache
 * * Dwoo
 * * Plain PHP/HTML
