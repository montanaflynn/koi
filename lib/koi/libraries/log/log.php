/**
 * The Logger class can be used to write, what else, log files. What you're
 * going to log is all up to you, Koi just provides you with the required tools.
 *
 * h2. Logging Data
 *
 * Before we can start logging data we need to create a new instance of the logger.
 * Creating a new logger instance is as simple as the following:
 *
 * @$l = new Koi\Log\Logger();@
 *
 * As you can see this works very much like the view system provided by Koi.
 * The only difference is that defining options has to be done using an associative
 * array as the second argument of the construct. Example:
 *
 * @$l = new Koi\Log\Logger('file', array('date_format' => 'd-m-Y'));@
 *
 * Writing data can be done by calling the write() method on the object
 * created earlier.
 *
 * @$l->write("HARRO!");@
 *
 * For more information see each individual logger or the log interface.
 *
 * h2. Creating Loggers
 *
 * Creating a new logger is fairly easy, create a class that implements the LogInterface
 * and add the class to the available drivers. A basic class looks like the following:
 *
 * bc. <?php
 * class MyLogger implements LogInterface
 * {
 *   public function __construct($options = array())
 *   {
 *
 *   }
 * 
 *   public function write($data)
 *   {
 *	
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * Once your class is done you can add it to the list of available drivers as following:
 *
 * @Koi\Log\Log::$drivers['mylogger'] = 'Koi\Log\MyLog';@
